# To Do List

See it live: [DCAM To Do List](http://www.work.dacapomusic.ca/)

## Description
A customized to-do app created for a music school business that allows user to create to-do items with different priority levels, edit them at any time, move them to other columns depending on their completion status, and delete them.

## Background & Process
This project was originall conceived and later on modified using direct feedback of an administrator of a music school business. The user needed a way to keep track of daily to-do tasks and keep track of their progress. I have gone through several modifications of this app following direct feedback from the person using it.

## Technologies
The current version of this project was done with:
* HTML
* Bootstrap
* CSS
* JavaScript

## State of Completion
Completed but not connected to a database yet.

## Learning Lessons & Challenges
### Creating edit, delete and move functionality for each to-do item
This was a fun challenge here that I really enjoyed. For editing to-do items, I decided to just go with the JavaScript prompt() method although I could also have created a modal for this as well. I wanted to keep things simple and minimal, however. Moving items between columns was an easier task than it seemed, by simply using the append() method on desired columns. 

## Areas of Improvement
The next thing I might do here is add storage functionality so that the to-do items are saved at all times. If this is done, I might also need a login page so that only intended users can have access to the to-do items.

## Summary
This was a nice little challenge and helped me review many important concepts in JS. I really enjoyed doing it and most of all am happy that the end-user is extremely pleased with it!
